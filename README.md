This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.



Features:

1. Encrypt plaintext messages using a specified key (shift).

2. Decrypt ciphertext messages using the same key used for encryption.

3. Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving non-alphabetic characters.
